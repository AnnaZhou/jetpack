#Machine Learning Jetpack

Machine learning tools are notorious for having byzantine dependencies and often academic code quality. At  [Startup.ML](http://startup.ml/) we have been using Docker to simplify the process of getting these tools on our machines.

## Currently supported tools

* Deeplearning4J
* Julia
* PyMC
* Theano
* Torch7
* Spark MLlib
* Vowpal Wabbit (VW)

```
./build.sh julia
```

or to build all tools

```
./build.sh 
```
