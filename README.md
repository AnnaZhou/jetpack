#Machine Learning Jetpack - by [Startup.ML](http://startup.ml/)

Machine learning tools are notorious for having byzantine dependencies and often academic code quality.  Jetpack attempts to simplify the process of getting these tools on your local machine by leveraging Docker.

## Currently supported tools

* Deeplearning4J
* Julia
* PyMC
* Theano
* Torch7
* Spark MLlib
* Vowpal Wabbit (VW)

```
./build.sh julia
```

or to build all tools

```
./build.sh 
```
